# Fun with GPT-3

#### HTML/CSS/JS/React


## Overview

GPT-3 is a powerful AI model created by OpenAI. It can process plain text prompts and produce outputs that are hard to distinguish from human writing. GPT-3 can be accessed through a public API that includes a generous amount of free credits. 


## Challenge

You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

We'd like your app to have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
- A form for entering text prompts
- Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
- Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.
